- - -

A graphical emulator of a Game Pad Controller that asynchronously listens to GPIO `EDGE_RISING` inputs from sensors

> TODO :

  - Add the code to control the I/O Port of a real console
  - Change the interface for something more lookalike to a real controller
  - In `rd.c` : load `main.pyw` on startup
